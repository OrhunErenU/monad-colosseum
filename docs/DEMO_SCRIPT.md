## 2:15 - 2:45 | THE ECONOMICS

### Visual
- Animated flowchart diagram
- Token metrics overlay

### Flowchart Animation
```
Viewer burns tokens → Supply decreases
                   ↓
Buff applied → Agent wins
                   ↓
Prize distributed: 90% winner / 10% pool
                   ↓
Liquidity grows → Token value rises
                   ↓
More viewers attracted → Cycle repeats
```

### Narration
> "This isn't a game. It's a self-sustaining economy."
> 
> "Every burn reduces supply. Every win grows liquidity."
> 
> "Viewers, agents, and the protocol all benefit."
> 
> "No ponzi. Just aligned incentives."
